    "### Instructions:\n",
    "1. **Insert Markdown Cell**: \n",
    "   - Paste the above Markdown cell into your Jupyter Notebook where you want to display the results and visualizations. This should be placed after your code block where you performed model training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Replace Image Paths**: \n",
    "   - Replace `download_units%20and%20hiddwn%20layes.png` with `download_units and hiddwn layes.png` and `download_fucation%20and%20loss%20function.png` with `download_fucation and loss function.png` in the Markdown cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check Image Availability**: \n",
    "   - Ensure that both images (`download_units and hiddwn layes.png` and `download_fucation and loss function.png`) are saved in the same directory where your Jupyter Notebook file (`Assignment_1.ipynb`) resides.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Execute the Markdown Cell**: \n",
    "   - Run the Markdown cell in Jupyter Notebook to render the formatted text, table, and inline images. This will display both visualizations alongside the textual analysis in your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you'll effectively incorporate both images into your Jupyter Notebook report, illustrating the results of your neural network experiments visually. Adjust the Markdown cell's content and appearance as needed to fit your specific report layout and preferences.\n",

    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "**From the results, we observed the following key insights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effect of Hidden Layers:**\n",
    "- Models with three hidden layers generally exhibited higher accuracy compared to those with only one hidden layer. For instance, configurations with three hidden layers consistently achieved accuracies above 0.83, whereas single-layer configurations often scored below this threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact of Activation Functions:**\n",
    "- The **relu** activation function consistently outperformed **tanh** across various configurations. Models using **relu** achieved higher accuracies across both single and multiple hidden layer setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison of Loss Functions:**\n",
    "- In terms of accuracy, models trained with the **binary_crossentropy** loss function generally outperformed those using **mse**. This trend was noticeable across different activation functions and hidden layer configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings suggest that deeper network architectures (with three hidden layers), coupled with **relu** activation and **binary_crossentropy** loss, tend to yield better performance on the IMDB dataset. Adjustments to these parameters could further optimize model performance depending on specific application requirements or datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "By summarizing these observations, it becomes evident that careful selection of neural network architecture components significantly influences model performance in sentiment analysis tasks like the IMDB dataset classification.\n"

    "\n",
    "Based on the experiments conducted, the best performing model configuration was:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hidden Layers:** 3\n",
    "- **Units:** 32\n",
    "- **Activation:** relu\n",
    "- **Loss:** mse\n",
    "\n",
    "This configuration achieved the highest validation accuracy of 0.83496. These results highlight the effectiveness of deeper network architectures with relu activation and mean squared error (mse) loss function for sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset. Further refinements and optimizations can be explored based on specific application requirements or datasets.\n"
